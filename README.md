## Getting started

## Why Obsidian Manager

If you only need notification messages on the computer side, not on the mobile side, then you can use the obsidian-reminder plugin.
If you just want to simply transfer yesterday's unfinished work to today's diary, use obsidian-rollover-daily-todos directly.

But to our plugin:

1. Work with ntfy, and support free server in few weeks, you can receive reminders from obsidian on any device such as calendar reminder, birthday reminder, etc..
2. Can support more complex scenarios, such as supporting asynchronous logic in templater in conjunction with the ability to transfer todo
3. More functions will be added in the future.
